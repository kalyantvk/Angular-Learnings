--> Import Angular Routing while creating the project itself. So, that app-routing.module.ts file will be created.
--> add the paths you want to create in the application by adding object to routes array in the app-routing.module.ts file
--> make sure to import all the components which ever you are using in the routes array.
--> create array with all the components used at the end of the file. Like given below,
              export const routingComponents=[AppComponent,ItemsComponent];
--> In app.module.ts file import this array using import { AppRoutingModule,routingComponents } from './app-routing.module';
--> Add the imported array to Declarations inside app.module.ts file
               declarations: [
                AppComponent,
                ItemsComponent,
            --> routingComponents <--
              ]
--> Finally add <router-outlet></router-outlet> in your app.component.html. While routing to different paths the expected component will replace this <router-outlet>
