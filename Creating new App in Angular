To create a new workspace and initial starter app:

Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:


    >> ng new my-app
    
    
The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.

Run the following command:

    >> cd my-app
    >> ng serve --open
    
    
The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to http://localhost:4200/.

If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a browser opening our application
