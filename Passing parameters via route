First in the app-routing.module.ts create the route with desired parameters. 
  Ex: {path:'contactus/:id',component:ContactusComponent}
  Here id is the parameter we are passing throught the route
in the Component in which we want to parse the parameter passed via route 
  --> Inject with ActivatedRoute 
      constructor(private route:ActivatedRoute) { }
in the ngOnInit() methodm,
  --> subscribe to the params 
      this.route.params.subscribe(params =>{
        this.id=params['id'];
      });
      
      here id is our instance variable. to which we are saving the params passed.
